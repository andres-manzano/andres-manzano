# Hello everyone! I'm Andres Manzano👋

## About me:

My passion lies in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science/Machine Learning. I enjoy building scalable solutions that create real-world impact. With two years of experience in IT consulting, my expertise spans cloud-based AI architectures, data processing, and ML systems—applying best practices to deliver efficient and reliable results.

I enjoy working with cloud platforms (primarily Azure, but also AWS and GCP), FastAPI, LangChain, and OpenAI. I’m constantly exploring new tools and pushing the limits of what AI can do. For me, every project is an opportunity to learn, iterate, and grow.

I love learning new things about AI and Data Science, finding new ways to apply them in real-world scenarios. I continuously challenge myself to improve—each project represents a step forward in my knowledge, skills, and career.

Azure Certifications:
✅ Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate
✅ Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate
✅ Four Fundamentals: Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900), Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900), Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900), Security, Compliance & Identity Fundamentals (SC-900)

I like languages. I speak Spanish (mother tongue), English and I'm learning German.
